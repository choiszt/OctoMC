RESPONSE SAMPLE iter1:
Explain: Since this is the initial request, there's no prior code to explain or evaluate. The task is to find and mine sand in Minecraft using Mineflayer. I can find a sand block in pic6 at the direction yaw=5.24, and the distance is 28.5 and 28.52.


Subtask:
1) perceive and go near by the sand block

}
```

RESPONSE SAMPLE iter2:
Explain: Since we have successfully perceive the sand, then we can use the mineBlock function to dig a sand block.
