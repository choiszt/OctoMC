2) Mine 1 dark_oak_log.

Code:
```javascript
// No helper functions are needed for this task

// Main function
async function mineWoodLog(bot) {
  // Subtask 1: Perceive and teleport near the dark_oak_log
  await bot.chat("Finding wood log...");
  await teleport(3.14, 6.96); // Teleport close to the dark_oak_log based on observed direction and distance

  // Subtask 2: Mine 1 dark_oak_log
  await bot.chat("Mining wood log...");
  await mineBlock(bot, "dark_oak_log", 1); // To collect 1 dark_oak_log
}
```
