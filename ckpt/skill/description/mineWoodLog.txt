async function mineWoodLog(bot) {
    // The function is about mining a wood log block. First, it checks if there is any wood log in the inventory. If there is, it returns. If not, it explores the environment until it finds a wood log block nearby. Once a wood log block is found, it mines it. After mining, it checks if the wood log was successfully mined. If it was, it sends a message saying it successfully mined a wood log.
