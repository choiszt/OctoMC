async function mineWoodLog(bot) {
    // The function is about mining a specific type of wood log. First, it explores the environment until finding the specified wood log within a maximum distance of 32 blocks. If no wood log is found, it sends a chat message and exits the function. If a wood log is found, it mines one block of the wood log. Then, it checks if the wood log is successfully mined and sends the corresponding chat message. If the wood log is not successfully mined, it sends a chat message and recursively calls the function again.
