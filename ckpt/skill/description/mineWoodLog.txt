async function mineWoodLog(bot) {
    // The function is about mining a wood log. It first checks if a wood log is already in the inventory. If so, it sends a chat message saying that it already has a wood log. If not, it searches for a nearby log block and mines it. After mining the wood log, it sends a chat message indicating that it has successfully mined a wood log. If no log block is found nearby, it sends a chat message saying that it couldn't find any wood logs nearby.
